# Validator Node Docker Environment

This repository provides a modular and extensible Docker-based environment for running validator nodes in a metagraph-based network. It supports multiple services, including:

- `metagraph-l0`
- `currency-l1`
- `data-l1`

Each component is packaged as a JAR, configured via environment variables, and managed with modular scripts for startup, health checking, and auto-recovery.

---

## üß™ Features

- Service modularity: scripts per layer
- Snapshot hash consistency verification (for `metagraph-l0`)
- Integrated health checks with retries
- Automatic restart on process failure or unhealthy state
- Optional dynamic seedlist download support
- Environment-configured for testnet/mainnet flexibility

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with necessary ports, credentials, node info, and optional seedlist settings:

```env
NODE_IP=0.0.0.0
ENVIRONMENT=testnet

# Example port config
METAGRAPH_L0_PUBLIC_PORT=9100
CURRENCY_L1_PUBLIC_PORT=9200
DATA_L1_PUBLIC_PORT=9300

# Optional seedlist
METAGRAPH_L0_SEEDLIST_URL=https://example.com/seedlist.txt
METAGRAPH_L0_SEEDLIST_NAME=seedlist.txt

# Peer IDs, keystore config, etc.
```
### 2. Build and Start

Use Docker Compose to build and run the services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build && docker-compose logs -f
```

## üìã Monitoring

To manually check logs for a specific service:
```bash
docker exec -it pacaswap-node tail -f /app/metagraph-l0/logs/app.log
```
Replace metagraph-l0 with the service you want to monitor.

## üîÅ Health & Recovery

Each service is:
* Periodically health-checked via HTTP
* Restarted automatically if the process dies
* Restarted if the node is stuck in an unhealthy state (WaitingForDownload, SessionStarted, etc.)
* For metagraph-l0, the snapshot hash is validated against a known source
